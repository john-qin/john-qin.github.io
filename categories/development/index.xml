      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started to blog 11 years ago. The first blog system i used, was Dotclear, I moved to Wordpress few years after because of the large plugin and theme ressources available. Wordpress is a really good blog platform, but it updates itslef too often for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few months ago, the blog moved to Ghost, a really minimalist blog system, based on nodejs. A KISS aproach to the blog, I falled in love. The only issue i had with Ghost was about the hosting dependencies, no hard to manage, but since i donâ€™t master nodeJs, i spent too much hours to hack into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered HUGO. Hugo is a static blog generator, written with a language (GOLANG), i use everyday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, i moved from GHOST to HUGO hosted on Google App engine.&lt;/p&gt;
